# Hi there 👋, I'm Lionel Guaregua

I'm a Software Developer from Venezuela, libing in Caracas with a passion for coding and a knack for problem-solving. I love using my skills to create solutions that make a difference.

## About Me

I'm a detail-oriented Software Developer who loves a good challenge. I have a strong background in Web3 development and am always looking to broaden my skillset. In my spare time, I enjoy learning more about the world of decentralization and how it can be harnessed to create innovative solutions.

In addition to my technical interests, I have a deep love for animals and am committed to their welfare. I believe that compassion towards all creatures is an essential quality and I strive to bring that belief into every aspect of my life.
